I will be traveling internationally and I have scheduled my Visa Interview on September 24th. I want to seek your advice on a few things regarding my travel and Visa interview.

1. Do you have any checklist for documents that I need to carry for the interview?
2. My current work location will be Vienna, US at company HQ, correct? Do I need to mention anything about the past 6 months when I worked remotely?
3. What should be my answers if I specifically got asked about the last 6 months when I worked remotely?
4. I had one offer letter which mentioned Vienna,US as location. Then due to my temporary remote work request, I got another offer letter that mentions my remote location as work location. Which one should I carry now that I have started reporting to Vienna? Should I ask HR to generate a new offer letter?
5. Is there any other travel advice?
