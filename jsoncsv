I will be traveling internationally and I have scheduled my Visa Interview on September 24th. I want to seek your advice on a few things regarding my travel and Visa interview.

1. Do you have any checklist for documents that I need to carry for the interview?
2. My current work location will be Vienna, US at company HQ, correct? Do I need to mention anything about the past 6 months when I worked remotely?
3. What should be my answers if I specifically got asked about the last 6 months when I worked remotely?
4. I had one offer letter which mentioned Vienna,US as location. Then due to my temporary remote work request, I got another offer letter that mentions my remote location as work location. Which one should I carry now that I have started reporting to Vienna? Should I ask HR to generate a new offer letter?
5. Is there any other travel advice?


In the employment letter, the dates of employment are listed as May 30th, 2023 â€“ Present. However, on my DS-160, I have mentioned both my current and previous employment. My current job is shown as starting on December 18th, and my previous employment as May 30th to December 15th.

I worked as a summer associate from May 30th, 2023, to August 16th, 2023, and then as a part-time intern from August 23rd, 2023, to December 15th, 2023. This aligns with my F1 status. I'm just unsure about the exact dates on my LCA, as I haven't been able to locate them.

So, to confirm, the DS-160 correctly shows my current job starting on December 18th and my previous employment from May 30th to December 15th, right?
